Music Discovery App. Revolutionary. 

Have you ever been bored of the same old genre of music? Apps like Pandora and Spotify only singing the same old song? Never again! Get introduced to whole new worlds and genres of music! Only takes 15 seconds of your precious time! BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE! Create an entirely NEW playlist of songs that you never thought existed! Step out of your alpha comfort zone and into your beta. 

Randomly pulls music from a database and starts to play the song one minute in for 15 seconds. User judges if s/he likes the song and rates it thumbs up or thumbs down. The app creates a list of favorite songs. Purpose is to introduce people to new music fast and without bias.
